# Retails-Data-Analysis-Project
The "Retail Data Analysis" is a comprehensive and automated **Retail Sales Analysis Project** that utilizes various technologies and tools to provide valuable insights into customer buying patterns and seasonal trends. The project involves six major steps:
### 1. Amazon Web Services (AWS):
   
   Created an AWS S3 bucket and uploaded raw files securely. Implemented roles and policies for secure access and user-specific operations.

2. Snowflake (SQL):
   Established table creation and storage integration with AWS.
   Connected AWS S3 to Snowflake for continuous data upload tracking. Set up a snowpipe to ingest files and copy data into existing tables.

3. Jupyter Notebook (Python):
   
   Established a connection between Snowflake and Jupyter Notebook.
   Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including data cleaning and analysis. Stored cleaned data back into Snowflake using the snowflake-python package.

4. Jupyter Lab (Python):
   Automated the EDA process using jupyter_scheduler and jupyterlab-scheduler.
   Enabled scheduled refreshes in Jupyter Lab to avoid repetitive commands.

5. Snowflake (SQL):
   Created a master table and implemented Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using cleaned data.
   
6. Power BI:

   
This dataset contains household-level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of each householdâ€™s purchases, not just those from a limited number of categories.
